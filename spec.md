# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application
   I have a full working CLI that allows user to input choices and receive information and then moves along to the next choice.
- [X] Pull data from an external source
    I have a scraper class that is pulling data from this Wikapedia page. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Michelin_3-star_restaurants
- [X] Implement both list and detail views
    I give a list of either countries or restaurants and then allow the user to choose a country or restaurant for more information.
