# Glows

  - Neat idea!  Very cool to be able to see by country

# Grows

  - User interface is a little hard to read with no spacing... a couple empty `puts` could help
    - Also the first menu could be a little easier to read
  - When user is asked whether he or she wants to exit, it exits regardless of the response
  - An invalid entry ends the program on the first prompt  
  - Looks like we're scraping seven or eight times, but it's the same site

# Refactor opportunities

  - Done!!move 'require' calls out of classes and in to environment file
  - clean up user interface, including handling bad user input
    - add empty puts and/or '_________----------**********'
  - Done!!move all `puts` statements to CLI class
  - Done!!add module namespacing
  - DONE !! scrape only once è€€
